# Bluetooth-Battery-Car
## Synopsis
In this project, we modified our autonomous rover from a previous project and implemented an HC-05 Bluetooth Transmitter/Receiver in order to receive commands from a mobile device. The purpose of the project is to apply what we have learned about and further understand UART communication.
